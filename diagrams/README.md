# Supplementary Diagrams

### `op_counts_by depth`
Operation counts from each of the three test runs from the paper, organized by model and cell depth. Notice the relative similarities between cells at the same depth.

### `op_counts_by_type`
Operation counts by cell type. Notice the frequency difference of operations between normal and reduction cells.

### `model1_cell0`
The connectivity of the first cell from the first model. Operation color keys are the same as in the frequency plots. Notice the ResNet-esque connections occuring at different scales, like the two-node patterns at `0_x→0_1`, `0_y→0_2`, `0_1→0_out` or the three-node patterns like `0_x→0_0→0_2` or `0_0→0_1→0_out`.
